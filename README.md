coderbyte-challenges
====================

This is a collection of solutions to the easy challenges on coderbyte.com as I complete them.
I am trying to learn Javascript, and I barely know how to use github, so this will be a two-fold learning process for me.

There are many ways to answer all of the problems on coderbyte, and these are not necessarily the best or most straightforward, but they do work. Please take them with a grain of salt because I am by no means an expert.

I also included a couple of random functions that I felt the need to document, just because.
